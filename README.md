# Chirper

[Chirper](https://peaceful-peak-3787.herokuapp.com/) is a sample rails app
I made to familiarize
myself with rails development.  The code is based almost entirely
on the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).  It's a great book
for anyone who wants to learn rails.
